// This file is used to configure TypeScript for the Expo project.
// It extends the base configuration provided by Expo and adds custom paths for easier imports.
// The paths are defined to allow for cleaner and more organized imports throughout the project.
// The "include" section specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process.
// The "expo-env.d.ts" file is included to provide type definitions for environment variables in Expo.
// The "expo/types/**/*.ts" pattern is included to ensure that Expo's type definitions are recognized by TypeScript.
// The "strict" option is set to true to enable strict type checking, which helps catch potential errors early in the development process.
